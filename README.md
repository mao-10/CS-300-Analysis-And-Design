# What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
I needed to create a program that organized and create objects from course data on a csv file. the courses had to be put into a data structure that could be searched, added into, and displayed. 
# How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
I had to first understand what data I would be working with. From there I had to decide what data structure would work best for the project. The data structure chosen is important because it can affect run time.
# How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
To overcome roadblocks, I did a lot of thorough research on the data structure I was using. 
# How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
It made me consider the importance of data structures more. Why a structure is chosen should be done more carefully. 
# How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
It has made me make sure I am not repreating myself and am creating clean, readable code.
